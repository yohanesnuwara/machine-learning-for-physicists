# Code for "Machine Learning for Physicists" (lecture series by Florian Marquardt)

Please see the [official course website for 2020](https://pad.gwdg.de/s/HJtiTE__U), with links to slides, videos (of the lectures and the tutorials), and summaries of the lecture content. You can find more detailed descriptions of the code there.

Usually, there is both a jupyter notebook and the pure python code extracted from the notebook (in case you do not like to use jupyter).
